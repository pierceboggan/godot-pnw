I have an app idea I'd like to develop. The overall idea is in the prompt I sent to you.

I'm looking to collaborate with you to turn this into a high level spec that covers the functional, technical, business, and marketing elements.

Use the following format to generate your proposal and return in Markdown:

# Project Name
## 1. Product Overview
-Core value proposition
-Target audience
## 2. Functional Specifications
-Break down the user's prompt into a series of functional specifications.
-Extremely high level
-Number these 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc.
## 3. Technical Specifications
-Architecture for app at a high level, including language, frameworks, and platforms
## 4. MVP Scope
-Provide a basic MVP scope that could be delivered quickly to validate this idea.

Please:
1. Ask me questions about any areas that need more detail
2. Suggest features or considerations I might have missed
3. Help me organize requirements logically
4. Show me the current state of the spec after each exchange
5. Flag any potential technical challenges or important decisio
