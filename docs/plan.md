    - `README.md`: Basic project documentation
    - `.gitignore`: Git ignore configuration
  - **Step Dependencies**: None
  - **User Instructions**: Install Godot 4.x from the official website if not already installed
  - **Verification**: Open Godot, confirm project loads without errors. You should see an empty project with the folder structure in place.

## Summary

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Pacific Northwest Survival game MVP in Godot within a day. The plan follows a logical progression starting with core systems and building up to more complex features:

1. We begin with project setup and importing necessary assets to establish the foundation.
2. Next, we implement the core player systems including movement and the critical dampness/caffeine meters.
3. The environment and weather systems create the PNW atmosphere and provide the main challenge.
4. The interaction system allows the player to engage with coffee shops and collectible items.
5. The mission system gives the player objectives and purpose within the game.
6. Finally, we integrate everything together, balance the gameplay, and add finishing touches like audio.

Each step in this plan results in a buildable, runnable state of the game with clear verification points to ensure progress is being made correctly. By testing after each step, you'll catch issues early and maintain momentum throughout development.

Key considerations for successful implementation:
- Focus on functionality over visual polish
- Use simple placeholder assets where appropriate
- Test each system as it's implemented
- Adjust the scope if any single step takes too long
- Prioritize the core gameplay loop over secondary features
